    <h3 style="width: 800px;">The ultimate Baileys Chocolate Ripple Cake decorated with fresh berries and chocolate.... this simple dessert takes just 10 minutes to prepare and is the perfect no-bake 'adults-only' recipe!</h3>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>600 ml cream thickened or whipping</li>
        <li>100 ml Baileys Irish Cream</li>
        <li>250 g Arnott's Choc Ripple biscuits or any plain sweet chocolate cookies</li>
        <li>fresh berries, chocolate and fresh mint leaves to decorate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol style="width: 800px;">
        <li>Place the cream in a bowl and beat with handheld beaters or a stand-mixer until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Add the Baileys Irish Cream and gently beat through until combined.</li>
        <li>Spread some of the whipped cream along the base of your serving dish.</li>
        <li>Hold one chocolate ripple biscuit in your hand. Spread a teaspoon of whipped cream onto the flat edge and place another chocolate ripple biscuit on top. Repeat until you have a stack of 3-4 biscuits in your hand.</li>
        <li>Place the stack standing upright onto the cream on the serving plate. Repeat with another 3-4 biscuits and then join that stack to the serving platter to form one long log.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all of the biscuits have been used.</li>
        <li>Use the remaining whipped cream to spread over the entire outside of the log.</li>
        <li>Chill in the fridge.<br>For best results, place log in the fridge overnight before serving (as this will allow the biscuits to soften). </li>
        <li>Decorate with fresh berries, chocolate (see notes) and fresh mint leaves. </li>
    </ol>
