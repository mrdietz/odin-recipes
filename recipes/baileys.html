    <h1>Tiramisu</h1>
    <img src="tiramisu-5.jpg" style="width: 400px;">
    <h3 style="width: 800px;">Literally meaning “pick me up” in Italian, this heavenly tiramisu will do just that! Every scrumptious bite has elements of a lightly sweetened and wonderfully rich mascarpone filling dotted with coffee-flavoured ladyfinger sponge and a hint of coffee liquor.</h3>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>250ml espresso</li>
        <li>40ml Kahlua</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>3/4 cup caster sugar</li>
        <li>750 grams mascarpone</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>30 Savoiardi ladyfinger sponges</li>
        <li>cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol style="width: 800px;">
        <li>Make the espresso coffee and add to a medium bowl. Add the Kahlua (if using). Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Over your stove, set up a small saucepan of gently simmering water. Add the egg yolks and sugar to a large, heat-proof bowl that will fit snugly over the saucepan without allowing steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl carefully over the saucepan, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the boiling water. Using electric beaters (or a whisk), continually beat the yolks and sugar over the heat until they become pale, fluffy and roughly double in volume. Allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Using electric beaters on low speed, add the mascarpone and vanilla bean paste to the egg yolk mixture and beat until stiff.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Assembly:</h2>
    <ol style="width: 800px;">
        <li>Place the coffee, Savoiardi ladyfinger sponges and a 18 X 29 cm tray on a bench, ready to assemble.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, dip each side of the sponge fingers into the coffee and Kahlua mixture. * Only dip for 1 second each side, as too long will cause them to become too soggy.</li>
        <li>Allow any excess coffee to drip from the sponges and assemble them in a single layer in the bottom of the dish. If there are any gaps, cut some sponge fingers to fit.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the top of the sponge layer.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process with a final layer of coffee soaked sponges. For the final layer, either spread or pipe the remaining mascarpone over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight is best).</li>
        <li>Top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or some dark chocolate shavings, if you prefer.</li>
    </ol>
